Hostfind -- A tool for finding hostnames to scan

Takes a domain name and an optional dictionary file
of hostnames and does an iterative DNS lookup for
host.domain.

If no hostname file is provided by the user, Daniel
Miessler's original list is hardcoded as a default list.

Domains that have IPv4 address are printed
to stdout.
